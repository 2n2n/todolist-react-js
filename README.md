## State and Props
#### State 
- States are mutable (in Layman's term is changeable), it is used to identify the current state of your SPA or component.

#### Props
- Props on the other hand is immutable (Once loaded it will stay as is and will not change unless, your child's props are dependent to a parent's state.. it will definitely change.)
