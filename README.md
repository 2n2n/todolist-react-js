## State and Props
#### State 
- States are mutable (in Layman's term is changeable), it is used to identify the current state of your SPA or component.

#### Props
- Props on the other hand is immutable (Once loaded it will stay as is and will not change unless, your child's props are dependent to a parent's state.. it will definitely change.)


## Components
#### Two Types of components
- We can write components in two ways, either using a function or creating a class. With normal JS(your browser way) you cant create classes, we usually use ES6 for this in order to declare classes on our Javascript. Lukily, our `create-react-app` iscapable of doing so because it's using ES6 at the background.

A. Functional Component (dumb component)

B. Class-Based Component
